							<h1 class="major">More about My Education</h1>
							<p> Besides some of the core classes I've taken for my degree, I've also taken on educational leadership roles. In particular, I have been an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Phys2207/Phys2208 (Fundamentals of Physics I and II)
								since the beginning of third undergraduate year. As an undergraduate TA, I help cultivate a welcoming academic environment with undergraduate life sciences students with mentorship and guidance through physics concepts such as mechanics and thermodynamics.
							In the past, I've also met with students one-on-one on my own time to provide more tutoring when needed, and I have also helped the course staff organize the class through suggestions during staff meetings.

							My Laboratory and Technical Skills include, but are not limited to: <br>
							- Sterile techniques <br>
							- IR, UV-VIS, NMR, and Mass spectrometry  <br>
								- Column and Ion Chromatography  <br>
								- Gas Chromatography <br>
								- XRD <br>
								 - SEM  <br>
								 - LC <br>
								- Titration  <br>
								- Simple and Fractional Distillation <br>
								- Python <br>
								 - Java <br>
								 - MATLAB <br>
								 - Linux <br>
						<br>
						I've also taken a summer class regarding Differential Equations and MATLAB modeling. <br>
						<br>
						Examples of some of the non-technical classes I've taken that I believe contributed to my overall education were:
						<br>
						- Conflict Resolution and Negotiation
						<br>
						- Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues
