								The Language House: For two years, I was involved in a language-oriented residental program which aimed to create an environment where students
								could practice their target languages in order to gain a higher level of fluency.
								The program would involve four meetings per week where participants would converse or do activities while speaking their target language, or in my case, French. The second year I was a member of this organization, I became the
								Secretary of the Language House, and my responsibilities included attending biweekly meetings to discuss how to improve the Language House program experience for  members by planning social events and other engaging activities, as well as communicating with the Residence Hall director about students' expectations of the program.
								<br>
								The program's website can be found <a href="https://cornell.campusgroups.com/culh/home/">here</a>.</p>

								In my free time, I've also been a member of the Reserve Tennis Club, a recreational sports club that also competed in tournaments in the local area, as well as Coffee Club and the European Cultural Society.
								The Coffee Club is a group of people that meets once a week to learn how to make various beverages (examples include matcha lattes or espressos) and to talk about the history behind the drink, while the European Cultural Society
								focused on creating a space for students from Europe, or those interested in European cultures, to be able to explore those interests. <br>
								<br>
								Lastly, I've been a general member of Creme de Cornell, a food magazine on campus, and have attended their magazine launches and cooking demos. However, this past semester I also became the Webmaster for the club.
								As a Webmaster, I am in charge of any website redesign or updates that need to be done. The magazine's website can be found <a href="https://www.cremedecornell.net/">here</a>.</p><br>
