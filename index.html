<h1 style="margin=10px; font-size:45px"> Hello! My name is Iva Petrovic. </h1>

<p style="margin=10px; font-size:20px"> I am a senior at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York! Currently, I am getting my Bachelor's degree in Chemistry & Chemical Biology, with a minor in Physics.    <br>
 <br>
I am most interested in the intersection between Materials Science and Sustainability. So, I would love to work in condensed matter and materials physics, or materials synthesis. I am also interested in lithium-ion batteries, or renewable energies fields,     <br>
especially thin-film solar cell innovation or photovoltaic materials in general.     <br>
 <br>
Recently, I've also been looking to improve my programming skills and to learn more     <br>
about the different ways I can channel my creativity with coding. As of now, I have programming experience with Python, Java, and MATLAB, and I have also conducted computational research using Linux.    <br>
  <br> 
 To improve my programming skills, I designed this website by myself with HTML!   <br>
 <br>
With my Bachelor's degree in hand soon, I am looking to find a job that will be both innovative and challenging!    <p>
