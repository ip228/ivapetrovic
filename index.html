<h1 style="margin=10px; font-size:80px"> Hello! My name is Iva Petrovic. </h1>

<p style="margin=10px; font-size:60px"> I am a senior at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York!    <br> 
I am a Bachelor's degree student in Chemistry and Chemical Biology with a minor in Physics.    <br>
 <br>
I am most interested in the intersection between Materials Science and Sustainability,      <br>
so I would love to work in condensed matter and materials physics, or materials synthesis.     <br>
I am also interested in lithium-ion batteries, or renewable energies fields,     <br>
  especially thin-film solar cell innovation or photovoltaic materials in general.     <br>
 <br>
Recently, I've also been looking to improve my programming skills and to learn more     <br>
about the different ways I can channel my creativity with coding.     <br>
As of now, I have programming experience with Python, Java, and MATLAB.    <br>
I have also conducted computational research using Linux.    <br>
To learn more about programming, I decided to design this website by myself with HTML!   <br>
 <br>
With my Bachelor's degree in hand soon, I am looking to find a job that will be both innovative and challenging!    <p>
