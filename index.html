									<h2>My interests</h2>
									I am most interested in the intersection between Materials Science and Sustainability. So, I would love to work in condensed matter and materials physics, or materials synthesis.
									I am also interested in lithium-ion batteries, or renewable energies fields, especially thin-film solar cell innovation or photovoltaic materials in general.
									 <br>
									 <br>
									Recently, I've also been looking to improve my programming skills and to learn more     <br>
									about the different ways I can channel my creativity with coding. As of now, I have programming experience with Python, Java, and MATLAB, and I have also conducted computational research using Linux.    <br>
									  <br>
									 To improve my programming skills, I made this website with HTML!   <br>
									 <br>
									With my Bachelor's degree in hand soon, I am looking to find a job that will be both innovative and challenging!    <p>

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p> By December of 2021, I will have earned a B.A. in Chemistry with a minor in Physics from Cornell University. Some of the most important courses I've taken to earn my Bachelor's degree are: <br>
										<br>
										- Organic Chemistry I and II  <br>
										- Intro to Experimental Organic Chemistry  <br>
											- Intro to Physical Chemistry  <br>
											- Inorganic Chemistry <br>
											 - Water Chemistry for Environmental Engineering  <br>
											 - Laboratory in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology <br>
											- Fundamentals of Physics I and II  <br>
											- Oscillations, Waves, and Quantum Physics  <br>
											- Intermediate Experimental Physics <br>
											 - Basics of Quantum Mechanics <br>
											 - Intro to Programming with Python  <br>
											 - Object-Oriented 	Programming and Data Structures <br>
											 <br>
										 I've also gained skills outside of the classroom setting through either independent projects or research experience.</p>

									<h2>Career Goals</h2>
									<p>As of now, I'm interested in getting industry experience and then potentially attending graduate school in the future to further my technical knowledge.	I would be most passionate about a Ph.D. in fields related to Materials Science or other interdisciplinary fields involving Chemistry and Physics.	</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p> Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I've conducted research in Biological Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Materials Chemistry. I've been fortunate enough to have been able to
							do so in multiple laboratories, including one at the University of California at Riverside. My goal during my Bachelor studies was to work in various environments in order to both gain more clarity
						about my interests, as well as improve my teamwork and organization skills as I learn to adjust to each new working environment. Below are short summaries of the research I've done so far. </p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3> Atmospheric Data Research </h3>
									<h4> Hess Lab </h4>
									<p> I conducted literary research on how varying environmental conditions affect the chemical composition of the atmosphere, as well as analyzed the lognormality of the distribution of atmospheric data.
										Following this literary research, I also computationally researched the difference in the concentration of tropospheric ozone during summer and winter seasons by writing a graphing program using Linux and Vim.
									The Hess Lab focuses on the development of atmospheric chemical models which could be used to interpet atmospheric measurements and therefore improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. <br>
									<br>
									The lab's website can be found <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/hess/">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Environmental Engineering Research </h3>
									<h4> Reid Lab </h4>
									<p>I am developing an L-DOPA assay of oxidative activity in woodchip sequencing batch reactors to assess the effects of the bioreactor on oxidative conditions.
										The goal is to quantify oxidative activity in bioreactors, relate oxidative activity to carbon release rates, and assess how conditions such as an excess of Mn(II) or Fe(II) affect oxidative activities.
									Recently, I've started working on another assay whose aim is to spectrophotometrically detect the presence of the Mn3+-malonate complex formed by the enzymes in bioreactors that oxidize Mn(II) to Mn(III). <br>
									<br>
									The lab's website can be found <a href="https://reid.cee.cornell.edu/">here</a>.</p>	</p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Materials Chemistry Research</h3>
									<h4> REU Internship in Feng Lab </h4>
									<p> As a student in the MacREU summer program, I worked in Dr.Feng's lab during the summer of 2021. The MacREU program was a competitive REU summer internship funded by the NSF where
										students worked on projects that are related to the growth and application of thin films or monolayer materials. In my case, I specifically worked on synthesis of new MOFs (metal-organic frameworks, or
										crystalline materials composed of metal ions that are coordinated to organic ligands with pores that have the potential to be stable enough to be refilled with other compounds) with the tris(pyridin-4-yl)amine (tpa) organic linker.
